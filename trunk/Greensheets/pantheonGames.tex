The Pantheon Games are a team-building exercise instigated by the Caretaker and used by the gods to prove superiority over the other pantheons. Each pantheon wagers items of power on the Game's outcome. The winning pantheon may choose two items (typically, they reclaim their own item and that of their greatest rival), while the second pantheon may claim the third remaining item. The gods and the Caretaker accept Amaterasu as the arbiter of the games, although ultimately it is the Caretaker who secures the items and oversees their transfer to the victorious pantheons.

With Unity's arrival, the Caretaker has stated that Unity will participate as part of the Egyptian pantheon even though \cUnity{\they} has only arrived a few hours ago. Three items of unusually strong power have been wagered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Greek Pantheon} --- \iSandals{}
  \item \textbf{Norse Pantheon} --- \iHammer{}
	\item \textbf{Egyptian Pantheon} --- \iNecro{}
\end{itemize}

The Games themselves are a series of five competitions that take place in \pAmphitheater{}. For each competition, each pantheon chooses a single champion to represent them.
Each competition has the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Amaterasu or someone she has appointed to arbitrate in her place must be present and announce the start of the competition.
	\item All the champions from each faction and at least one other observer must be present.
	\item When the competition is over, the arbiter announces the ranking of the pantheons. The winning pantheon receives 3 points, the second pantheon reeives 2 points, and the remaining pantheon receives 1 point. If a pantheon's champion is not present for the competition, they receive nothing. There are no ties --- the arbiter always chooses a victor.
	\item The results of each competition are publicly recorded by the arbiter.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{2:30 --- 3:00, A} --- Description.
	\item \textbf{3:00 --- 3:30, A} --- Description.
	\item \textbf{3:30 --- 4:00, A} --- Description.
	\item \textbf{4:00 --- 4:30, A} --- Description.
	\item \textbf{4:30 --- 5:00, A} --- Description.
\end{itemize}

\emph{These rules are dictated by the Caretaker, who also controls access to the wagered items. The gods have not always agreed to follow the rules or participate in the Games, although historically the Caretaker has accepted Amaterasu's decision regarding the victor of the Games.}
