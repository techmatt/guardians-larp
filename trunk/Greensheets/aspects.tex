\name{\gAspect{}}

Some characters in game have one or more Aspects representing their inherent powers or attributes. Aspects are required by various mechanics, and can be invoked to increase a player's chance of winning various competitions. Once during each hour of game, you may invoke one of your Aspects. You can invoke the same Aspect during different hours of game. You may also have abilities that allow you to invoke Aspects under other conditions.

Sometimes invoking an Aspect requires playing two games of Taboo, which is described below. Your Aspect is not used until you start playing the second game. After the first game, you can decide not to continue, keeping your Aspect. If you decide not to play the second game, you can later change your mind and play the second game at any time.

\section*{Playing Taboo}

% Modified from Year 7 rules for taboo.
For Taboo, you will be given a word or phrase, as well as an additional list of forbidden words. You must get a player who has the Aspect to guess the word or phrase, but you may not use the word or phrase itself or any of the words indicated as forbidden. Don't use forms or parts of any of the words, either. If you accidentally use a forbidden word, tell the player the word or phrase you were trying to have them guess, and try again using one of the backup words provided.

The words or phases which must be guessed will have some connection to whatever you need the Aspect for. The second game of Taboo will generally have a more revealing word or phrase than the first game.
