\name{\cOsiris{}}

You are \cOsiris{}, son of the Earth and the Sky. You once ruled over Egypt, during a time of prosperity that is always pleasant to remember. Then you were murdered by your brother \cSet{}, and your body was torn into fourteen pieces, scattered throughout the world. \cIsis{}, your wife, restored you to life, but not even a reincarnated god is allowed to return to the land of the living, so you remained in the underworld as its new ruler. You witnessed the judgement of countless thousands of the dead, and welcomed the just into your realm.

But that was millenia ago.

A vortex appeared in the land of the dead and engulfed you. You awoke with your brothers and sisters, and other gods and mortals unknown to you, imprisoned in a strangely featureless building. Two beings who referred to themselves as the \cCaretaker{} and the \cWarden{} claimed to be responsible for this. You were filled with outrage. Who were these beings, to treat you this way? But neither you nor any other imprisoned god could do anything. Whatever kind of gods the \cCaretaker{} and \cWarden{} are, they are far more powerful than any of you.

The \cCaretaker{} and \cWarden{} referred to you gods as ``celestials.'' They claim you are not really gods. But you know what you are, and you know the power you have wielded. Your jailers eventually conceded this, and even created a small realm for you to rule over. This ``Egypt'' was only a shadow of the Egypt you once ruled over, and you had only one mortal follower here, \cEgyptianHuman{}. You and your brothers and sisters became restless from the confinement, and there

In time,

%The olympic games happened.

%After a millenium, various Egyptian gods went away.

%Set was killed, you came up with a way to escape, you lost your powers, in some order.

%Quite recent: Unity arrived, causing the death of Geb.
