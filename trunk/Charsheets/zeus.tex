\name{\cZeus{}}

You are \cZeus{}, leader of the mighty Greek Pantheon. Well, it would be mighty -- mightier -- if it weren't so small, and under the thumbs of the \cWarden{} and the \cCaretaker{}.  Many hundreds of years ago, you were surrounded by your extended family on Olympus and the only thing to worry about was how to hide your latest conquest from your wife. But now, most of your family is gone. Only your wife \cHera{}, daughter \cAthena{}, and son \cHephaestus{} remain. Oh, and \cPandora{}, that sweet girl who watches the box.

You aren't even on earth any more. For a few, glorious years, you and your family reigned over the earth from your seat on Mt. Olympus. Humans worshiped and feared you, and rightly so. It was a wonderful, carefree life -- appropriate for a God.  But one day all of Mt. Olympus was swallowed in a whirling vortex stronger than Charybdis. You and your family found yourselves ripped from earth and your followers, and imprisoned here in this stupid complex. Over the next 3000 years, the \cWarden{} and \cCaretaker{} attempted to brainwash your family into believing you were not in fact Gods. Instead, they claim you to be something called a ``celestial''. One by one, your family fell for their lies. They started to talk dreamily about the stars, and then the \cWarden{} and \cCaretaker{} would call a celebration. There would be a big party, and your beloved child or sibling would leave and never return.

Much of your life now consists of sitting around the fake Mt. Olympus that your jailers constructed, and watching earth as though it were a television show. It is maddening to be unable to influence earth any more. Mortals don't even quake at the natural thunderstorms any more. Curse the \cWarden{} and \cCaretaker{}. No God should be more powerful than you. None should be able to contain you. And yet you are contained.

To try to distract you from your imprisonment the \cCaretaker{} concocted the foolish idea of the \pGames{}. Once every hundred years or so, you are released from your prison cell -- alas, how could your beautiful Mt. Olympus have become no more than a prison cell? -- to compete with the Norse and Egyptian pantheons in a series of contests to prove dominance.
