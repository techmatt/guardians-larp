\name{\cHera{}}

Most humans on earth know you only as the vindictive \cHera{\spouse} of \cZeus{}. A few -- your most loyal followers -- remember you for your primary role as guardian of mothers. You are the ultimate mother, and the Greek Pantheon is your family. Unfortunately, in recent years your family has dwindled to almost nothing. You have only your \cZeus{\spouse}, \cZeus{}; your \cAthena{\offspring}, \cAthena{}; your \cHephaestus{\offspring}, \cHephaestus{}; and your adopted \cPandora{\offspring}, \cPandora{} left. The five of you have been imprisoned on a false Mt. Olympus by two Gods from an unknown and incredibly powerful pantheon, the \cWarden{} and the \cCaretaker{}.

Once, you were surrounded by your whole extended family. You were the queen of Mt. Olympus, and ruled over the earth with \cZeus{}. You were worshiped for your power, and your beauty was doubted by none save Paris. That was thousands of years ago. You were then ripped from your rightful place and imprisoned here in this complex, where you were forced to endure the lies of your jailers, who sought to delude you into believing you were not a goddess. One by one, your children and siblings fell for these lies and began to yearn for the stars instead of a return to your rightful place as gods and goddesses of Earth.

Eventually, you and \cZeus{} realized that it will be almost impossible to return to earth -- which is saying something for a Greek goddess to admit that anything might be impossible. You are proud, but not stupid. You recognize that the \cWarden{} and \cCaretaker{} are too powerful to be defied completely. So you cooked up a scheme to at least release your family from bondage to these two.

When you were first brought to the complex, the pantheons of Greek, Norse, Egyptian and Shinto were all kept together. The other pantheons failed to accept the superiority of the Greek, and this led to substantial conflict between the pantheons. Eventually the \cCaretaker{} and \cWarden{} used something called the \stone to make facsimile of Mt. Olympus, Egypt, Asgard, and Takama to house each of the pantheons separately. If you and \cZeus{} could gain access to the \stone, you should be able to find a way to subvert it to make a \emph{new} Mt. Olympus, beyond the reach of your jailers.  \cZeus{} and \cHephaestus{} have long been working on the problem, and there have been many complications. It is your understanding that you will need access to the \stone, as well as \iHammer{\MYname}, which is of course in the possession of the Norse.
