\TODO{Cross reference with Osiris's sheet}

% Begin with something like ``You well remember the day <you were teleported here>, <it completely disrupted your life>.''

% Introduce info about what kind of god she is as needed.

% What was her relationship with Geb?
% She probably knew of Geb doing something Anubis would judge unjust.

% Isis might think Osiris was responsible for Set's demise.

% Isis and Anubis know Osiris lost his powers.
% Doesn't know that Osiris is working with Hera to get them back.
% Has that conflict with Hera.

% Isis and Anubis are mad that Osiris put up the Necronomicon for the games.
% They think he's taking a stupid risk (and he thinks they're taking a stupid
% risk).

% Isis SHOULD NOT TRUST non-Egyptian gods besides maybe Hel.
% In particular, should be wary of trusting Unity.
% Maybe Geb's death is what make it hard for her.
% But escaping is still her first priority, and if Osiris forces her hand,
% she'll go with Unity as much as she dislikes him.

% Isis will backstab Set once she gets the info from him.
% Can't be too obvious about it though.

% Mempack if Geb's heart is judged unjust. (Not okay!)

% NOTE: There should be some preparation for escaping which is shared
% between the two methods of escaping.

% NOTE: More interaction with other pantheons?

% NOTE: Willing to knock Osiris unconscious and drag him along if that's
% the only way to resurrect Set and escape.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Regain the \iNecro{} for your pantheon.
  \item Resurrect \cSet{}.
  \item With \cSet{}'s help, escape the Complex with your pantheon and Hel.
  \item % Find out why Geb died.
  \item % Do not allow Geb to be judged. Or something? Find and hide evidence of what he did? Do something to his heart to remove the bad part?
