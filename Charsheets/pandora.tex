\name{\cPandora{}}

You are a construct of \cZeus{}, \cAthena{}, and \cHephaestus{}. You were created in order to protect your box.  \cZeus{} in \cZeus{\their} infinite wisdom saw fit to create a container for \emph{something}, and charge you with protecting it. What an exciting life. \#sarcasm.

You were swept up with the Greek Pantheon by the \cWarden{} and \cWarden{\their} associate, the \cCaretaker{} a couple of thousand years ago. Something about beeing too contaminated bo the Gods to be allowed to remain on earth. Of course you were ``contaminated'', you were a \emph{construct}. A human, even one protected by \cZeus{}, among Gods should have been killed intentionally or accidentally within a days. The \cWarden{} had other plans however. By taking some of your blood upon arrival, the \cWarden{} gave you \cWarden{\their} own protection. The very air around you absorbs attacks and prevents you from taking any damage.

The \cCaretaker{} was \emph{very} concerned with the wellbeing of the Gods, and came up with all kinds of stupid ideas, including building separate homes for the Greek, Norse, Egyptian and Shinto pantheons. \cCaretaker{\They} and the \cWarden{} used the \stone{} to create a copy of Mt. Olympus. \cZeus{} quickly decided that he wanted the stone for \cZeus{\them}self, and you resigned yourself to helping rather than risk \cZeus{\their} wrath.

The \cCaretaker{} also invented the \pGames{} to try to entertain the Gods. It was a welcome diversion for them, although you hated being forced to participate. You were never good enough to stack up to the Gods. Whichever competition you competed in, the Greeks would lose. At best this brought ridicule down on your head.

For the next 2000 years, your life was a living hell. The Gods were like petulant children, and all of them save the three who created you, and your adoptive mother \cHera{} tormented you. They couldn't kill you, but they could do everything from trip you, to spirit you hundreds of feet into the air just to watch you fall.  They pulled your hair, called you names, and worst of all, would take your box and threaten to open it.  Even though they had all been forbidden by \cZeus{} to do so, they loved to see your panicked reaction when they took the box. You became even more fiercely protective of your box, and avoided the company of everyone. 

You don't know what is in the box, honestly you don't much care. What matters is that \cZeus{} trusted \emph{you} with it, and not one of his actual children. \cZeus{\They} \emph{created} you for this purpose. In fact, it was the only purpose you had. If you failed it, what value would you have? That thought drove you for a long time, and embittered you toward the Gods who wished to take it away from you. The box -- and therefore \cZeus{}'s trust -- is all you had.

One by one, the Gods started to disappear. There was always a big party, which you of course avoided, and a ship. If only that ship could carry \emph{you} away instead. How you longed to leave the confines of the Complex. You watched earth through the viewing screens with a hunger to rival the God's desire for the stars. It all seemed so hopeless though.  The \cWarden{} and \cCaretaker{} had managed to imprison the Greek Gods, and you, as a mere construct, could not even deal with the gods. How could you possibly compete with their captors?

You sunk into a deep depression, that nobody noticed except \cHera{}. To your great surprise, \cHera{\they} showed genuine concern for you. Perhaps \cHera{\them} dominion over mothers and wives was not as misplaced as you originally thought. Over the years, the two of you became close, especially as \cHera{} and \cAthena{} grew apart -- they were constantly fighting.

%%Stuff about set and thor

About 100 years ago, you found another unexpected ally. The \cWarden{} approached you late one night with a proposition. He could sense your dislike of the gods Somebody get \cWarden{\them} them the Understatement of the Year Award. Regardless, \cWarden{\They} offered you a deal. The \cWarden{} claimed to have the power to send you back to earth. Of course \cWarden{they} wanted something first. \cWarden{} offered you a gun -- supposedly with the ability to take away a God's power.  All you had to do was take away all of the Gods' powers. \cWarden{\They} was suspiciously vague about why he was offering this to you, rather than just doing it \cWarden{\them}self. The \cWarden{}'s opinion of the gods was no secret. And yet, how could you pass up such a chance to get even with the gods? You took the gun. The \cWarden{} cautioned you that the gun would take some time to recharge between uses, and that you must be careful not to get caught by the \cCaretaker{}. Apparently the \cWarden{} was doing this without \cCaretaker{\them} blessing. Interesting\ldots{}

Rather than try the gun on the Greek Pantheon first, since it had dwindled to \cZeus{}, \cAthena{}, \cHephaestus{}, and \cHera{}, the four Gods who had ever shown you kindness and some semblence of respect, you decided to wait for a chance to attack one of the other Pantheons.  During the \pGames{} 70 years ago, you took your chance. Just as the games were concluding, you snuck back to your chambers and grabbed the gun. You pointed it at \cOsiris{} and pulled the trigger. The gun shook in your hands, and for a moment you feared that it might explode

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
  \item\textbf{Psychlim:} ``My Box'' You are almost constantly thinking about your box. You carry it everywhere for fear that someone might take it when you aren't looking. You are not willing to be parted from your box for more than a few seconds. You will actively try to prevent anyone from taking the box, or, Gods forbid, opening it. Feel free to role play your obsession appropriately.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Find a way to escape the Complex with \cUnity{} or \cOdin{}, or otherwise.
  \item Figure out if you should open your box or not. Regardless, don't ever let it out of your sight.
  \item Help the Greek Gods win the \pGames{}. If they lose and you fail to escape, the next 100 years will be unbearable.
  \item Steal the powers of as many gods as possible.
